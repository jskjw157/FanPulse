Task: Switch current git branch to feature/130-web-로그인-및-회원가입-화면-구현

What I did (summary):
- Verified current repo status with: git status -sb
- Found that local branch feature/130-web-로그인-및-회원가입-화면-구현 did not exist
- Confirmed that remote origin has a matching branch: origin/feature/130-web-로그인-및-회원가입-화면-구현
- Created a local tracking branch from the remote and switched to it:
  git switch -c feature/130-web-로그인-및-회원가입-화면-구현 --track origin/feature/130-web-로그인-및-회원가입-화면-구현
- Re-checked state with: git status -sb and git branch --show-current

Current result:
- Current branch: feature/130-web-로그인-및-회원가입-화면-구현
- This branch tracks: origin/feature/130-web-로그인-및-회원가입-화면-구현
- Untracked files present in working tree (no uncommitted changes were staged or committed in this operation)

Notes / Edge cases:
- If the remote branch did not exist, I would have created a local branch from HEAD or created a new tracking branch accordingly. Since it exists remotely, I followed the tracking setup.
- If uncommitted changes block the switch in the future, a manual resolution will be required (e.g., stash or commit). The current run did not modify existing changes.

Recommended follow-up:
- Ensure .gitignore excludes temporary/untracked artifacts as appropriate for your workflow.
- When ready, push or create a PR as needed (not performed per user instruction).
